= 13. MINIMUM SECURITY CONTROLS

Security controls must meet minimum security control baseline requirements. Upon categorizing a system as Low, Moderate, or High sensitivity in accordance with FIPS 199, the corresponding security control baseline standards apply. Some of the control baselines have enhanced controls which are indicated in parentheses.

Security controls that are representative of the sensitivity of Enter Information System Abbreviation are described in the sections that follow. Security controls that are designated as “Not Selected” or “Withdrawn by NIST” are not described unless they have additional FedRAMP controls. Guidance on how to describe the implemented standard can be found in NIST 800-53, Rev 4. Control enhancements are marked in parentheses in the sensitivity columns.

Systems that are categorized as FIPS 199 Low use the controls designated as Low, systems categorized as FIPS 199 Moderate use the controls designated as Moderate and systems categorized as FIPS 199 High use the controls designated as High. A summary of which security standards pertain to which sensitivity level is found in Table 13-1 Summary of Required Security Controls that follows.
